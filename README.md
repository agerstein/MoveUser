helps to move a users data from one computer to another

Usage
========
sudo ./move_user.sh

You can drag the directory you want to move into the terminal window, or you can pass it after the script as a variable, e.g.
sudo ./move_user.sh /Users/user 
(please note that if you pass the directory to the script this way, you need to put in a trailing space.)
